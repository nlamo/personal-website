# personal-website

New design - personal website.

TODO:

- Experiment with gradients for the background colour.
- Add a dark mode (or at least a toggle to invert the main display somewhat, just for fun).
- Continue to refine the basic structure/styling of the grids and sections.
- Tinker with grid and get the items to conform nicely to a set aspect ratio.
- Fix the zoom issue for the index page image/animation.
