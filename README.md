# personal-website

New design - personal portfolio website.

TODO:

- Make the contact form responsive for mobile.
- Perhaps completely *rebuild* the 'About' section
- Create multiple self-portraits, insert them into the relevant sub-grid in 'About', and then use CSS animations to make them 'animated' on hover
- Continue to refine the basic structure/styling of the grids and sections.
- Polish the footer and try and resolve some difficulties in the interaction with the main section.
