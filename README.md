# personal-website

New design - personal portfolio website.

TODO:

- FIX: Make sure that the opening animation *waits* for the images to load
- Continue to refine the basic structure of the grids and sections.
- Create multiple self-portraits, insert them into the relevant sub-grid in 'About', and then use CSS animations to make them 'animated' on hover.
- Make a PHP contact form for the 'Contact' section
- Polish the footer and try and resolve some difficulties in the interaction with the main section.
- Write all of the media queries only once the structure of the main view has been completed finished.
- Generally resolve any jankiness (refactor).
