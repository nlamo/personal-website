# personal-website

New design - personal portfolio website.

TODO:

- Perhaps completely *rebuild* the 'About' section.
- Experiment with gradients for the background colour.
- Create multiple self-portraits, insert them into the relevant sub-grid in 'About', and then use CSS animations to make them 'animated' on hover.
- Continue to refine the basic structure/styling of the grids and sections.
- Polish the footer and try and resolve some difficulties in the interaction with the main section.
- Fix the zoom issue for the index page image/animation.
