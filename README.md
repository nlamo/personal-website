# personal-website

New design - personal website.

TODO:

- Experiment with gradients for the background colour.
- Make 'About' section self-portrait into a CSS animation, experiment with variations.
- Continue to refine the basic structure/styling of the grids and sections.
- Tinker with grid and get the items to conform nicely to a set aspect ratio.
- Polish the footer and try and resolve some difficulties in the interaction with the main section.
- Fix the zoom issue for the index page image/animation.

THOUGHTS:

- Original portfolio will likely be much smaller than expected. Aim for four projects, and then stagger their descriptions with the project grid items, and style them accordingly on hover.
- Excluding the portfolio page from the hosted website until I've developed a somewhat respectable personal portfolio.
