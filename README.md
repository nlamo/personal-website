New design - personal portfolio website.

TODO:

- Experiment with gradients for the background colour.
- Make 'About' section self-portrait into a CSS animation, experiment with variations.
- Continue to refine the basic structure/styling of the grids and sections.
- Polish the footer and try and resolve some difficulties in the interaction with the main section.
- Fix the zoom issue for the index page image/animation.
