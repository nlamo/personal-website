# personal-website

New design - personal portfolio website.

TODO:

- Continue to refine the basic structure of the grids and sections.
- Create a large, lush landscape drawing (ink) for the main page.
- Create multiple self-portraits, insert them into the relevant sub-grid in 'About', and then use CSS animations to make them 'animated' on hover.
- Write the 'about-me' description for the 'About' section.
- Make a PHP contact form for the 'Contact' section
- Polish the footer and try and resolve some difficulties in the interaction with the main section.
- Write all of the media queries only once the structure of the main view has been completed finished.
